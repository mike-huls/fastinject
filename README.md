**FastInject** provides lazy dependency injection for Python that makes your code decoupled, testable, uncomplicated and more readable.
Decorate your services with the `@injectable` decorator and decorate your function with `@inject`. Done! 
Your function will now be injected with instances of the required service.
```shell
pip install fastinject
```

## Usage Example
Below details a minimal use case 

#### Step 1: Declare service to be injectable
We have a service that we want to inject, so we mark it `injectable` with a decorator:
```python
import time, datetime
from fastinject import injectable

@injectable()           # <-- Just add this decorator to declare the TimeStamp service to be injectable
class TimeStamp:
    ts: float

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.ts = time.time()

    @property
    def datetime_str(self) -> str:
        return datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(self.ts).strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
```

Step 2: Use the service in a function that is injected in
```python
from fastinject import inject

@inject()               # <-- This decorator will inject required services in this function
def function_with_injection(ts: TimeStamp):
    print(f"In the injected function, the current time is {ts.datetime_str}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    function_with_injection()
```

Step 3: Optinonally validate that all injected services can be injected:
```python
from fastinject import get_default_registry

if __name__ == "__main__":
    registry = get_default_registry()

    # Validate
    registry.validate()
    function_with_injection()

```

## How to use
Injecting services
- [Register and inject a single service](demo/demo1_inject_single_service.py).
- [Register and inject a single service as a singleton](demo/demo2_inject_single_service_singleton.py).

Inject services that depend on one another
- [ServiceConfig: Register multiple dependencies for injection](demo/demo3_inject_service_config.py).
- [ServiceConfig: Register nested dependencies for injection](demo/demo4_inject_service_config_nested_dependencies.py).

Use the service registy imperatively to get and set dependencies on the fly
- [Declare service to be injectable imperatively](demo/demo5_add_and_get_services_from_registry.py).
- [Declare service to be injectable and declare function to inject imperatively](demo/demo6_add_and_get_service_config_imperatively.py).

Use multiple registries?
- [Use multiple registries](demo/demo7_multiple_registries.py)

Register similar services?
- [Register multiple services of the same type?](demo/demo8_register_multiple_instances_of_the_same_type.py)

Validation
- [Validated registered services?](demo/demo9_eagerly_validate.py)
